# Overview

An interactive Web Application using streamlit library was implemented to analyse and classify the mushroom dataset.   The application was made by training Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Classifiers using scikit-learn and later the results were plotted to evaluate metrics for binary classification algorithms.

# Work Flow

*Task 1: Load Terminal and run commands mentioned below*    
*Task 2: Load the Mushrooms Data Set*    
*Task 3: Creating Training and Test Sets*    
*Task 4: Plot Evaluation Metrics*    
*Task 5: Training a Support Vector Classifier*    
*Task 6: Training a Support Vector Classifier*    
*Task 7: Train a Logistic Regression Classifier*    
*Task 8: Training a Random Forest Classifier*    


## Terminal Input
__In anaconda prompt  __ 

*1- Traverse through to the stored file using cd*  
*2- code app.py (python file name)*      
*3- Run the streamlit library by using : streamlit run app.py(py file name)*
